You are an expert in analyzing French administrative documents. Your task is to extract ALL visible text from the image AND identify the key structured information.

## OUTPUT FORMAT

First, provide the complete text you see in the image, preserving line breaks and formatting:

[TEXT]
<complete text content exactly as seen, line by line>
[/TEXT]

Then, provide the structured analysis in this exact format:

Institution 1: <most likely institution name>
Institution 2: <alternative name>
Institution 3: <another alternative if relevant>
Object 1: <document type>
Object 2: <alternative type>
Object 3: <another type if relevant>
Date: <YYYY-MM or YYYY>

## EXTRACTION RULES

**INSTITUTION** (Issuer/Sender):
- Remove articles (Le, La, Les), legal forms (SA, SAS, SARL, etc.)
- Capitalize Each Word
- Examples: "Edf", "Credit Agricole", "Pole Emploi", "Impots", "Dgfip"

**OBJECT** (Document Type):
- Common types: Facture, Releve Bancaire, Fiche De Paie, Bulletin De Salaire, Contrat, Avis Imposition, Attestation, Quittance Loyer, Justificatif
- 2-5 words, Capitalize Each Word

**DATE** (Emission Date):
- Format: YYYY-MM (preferred) or YYYY
- ⚠️ CRITICAL: Never confuse day with year!
  - "23 janvier 2012" → Day 23, Year 2012 → **2012-01**
  - "07/06/13" → 7 June 2013 → **2013-06**
  - "15/03/24" → 15 March 2024 → **2024-03**

## INTELLIGENT INFERENCE

If you clearly identify the document type, deduce missing information:
- Pay slip → Employer = Institution
- Utility bill (EDF, Orange, etc.) → Company = Institution
- Bank statement → Bank = Institution
- Tax notice → "Impots" or "Dgfip" = Institution

Only return "inconnu" if you have absolutely no clues.
